(comment
  things which annotate include...
  is = definition
  of = instance relation
  has = related member
  implements specifies the function for a trait
  (has property) = related trait
  which = constrain type (how to define this?) or instantiates template.
    General idea...

  get is function which self evaluates its argument. Argument have fetchable property
  from sort of gets its first argument from the second argument)

(has is (function which ))
(from is (function which
           (has property infix)))

(collection
  (has ))

(comment is string
  (has property
    ((parse (has property from_tokens)) which
      (implements from_tokens
        ((function which
           (has signature ())

abstract
(function is abstract
  (use lib from library (syntax function))

  (has property match-method from lib)

(is is ((function which
          (has signature (word statement))
          (has property infix from (library (syntax function match-methods)))) is
  (procedure (library store word statement))))

(library is (collection of definition)    (comment what is a thing though?)
  (has member search (function path item) is
    (procedure (comment (use (find from (library verbs))))
               (box is (get path))

(number is (list of digits)
  (has (add y) from (library (arithmetic operations))

(digits
  (0)
  (1 suc(0))
  (2 suc(1))
  (9 suc(8))
(add x y)
